# MCAA_Project
Project for "Markov Chains and Algorithmic Applications" class

## Goals of the project

We are given 'chain_i.p' files containing a function that can create samples from an unknown Markov chain.

### 1) Find Markov Chains Properties

First goal was to first determine some properties about those Markov chains.
- Are they time-homogeneous?
- Do they limiting/stationary distributions?

### 2) Sample from Arbitrary Distribution with Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Here, using the previous Markov chains that have been found to be time-homogeneous, the goal is to be able to sample from some given distributions by using the Metropolis-Hastings. We use the previously found chains as base chains.
